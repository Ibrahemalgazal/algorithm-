Directions: The sorting problem is defined as follows:  Input: sequence 𝑎1, 𝑎2, ⋯ , 𝑎𝑛 of numbers. Output: A permutation of the input 𝑎1 ′ , 𝑎2 ′ , ⋯ , 𝑎𝑛 ′ such that 𝑎1 ′ ≤ 𝑎2 ′ ≤ ⋯ ≤ 𝑎𝑛 ′ Task 1: Implement the following in C++ and show the output of your code for at least two instances of the problem. 1- Quicksort Quicksort and partition procedures given in the textbook (Textbook pseudocode is given in slides 11 and 13).  2- Partitioning methods The second and third partitioning methods, given in slides 22-25.  3- Randomized quicksort  Implement randomized quicksort (pseudocode is given in slide 35). 4- Another version of quicksort The version of quicksort and partition given in slides 36 and 37, where the pivot is included in the recursive call  of quicksort.  Task 2: If the pivot used in the quicksort version given in slide 36 becomes the last element instead of the first element,  would it still be a correct algorithm? Justify your answer.
